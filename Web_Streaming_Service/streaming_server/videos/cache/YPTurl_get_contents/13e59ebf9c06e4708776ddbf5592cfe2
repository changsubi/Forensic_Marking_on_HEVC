The Gear VR headset also includes a touchpad and back button on the side, as well as a proximity sensor to detect when the headset is on.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Samsung_Gear_VR\n\nDaydream\u00a0is a\u00a0virtual reality\u00a0(VR) platform developed by\u00a0Google\u00a0that is built into the\u00a0Android\u00a0mobile operating system.\u00a0Compatible phones that follow the platform's software and hardware specifications (and are thus designated \"Daydream-ready\") are used in the Google Daydream View\u00a0VR headset.
