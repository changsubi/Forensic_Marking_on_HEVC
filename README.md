## Real-Time DRM & Forensic Marking Method based on CUDA Parallel Processing
This project proposes a real-time DRM and forensic mark technology based on the HEVC/MPEG-H Part.2(H.265) standards. This technology ,on a GPU multi-core basis, utilizes the Entropy Coding technology only to approach the QTC (Quantified Transform Coordinators) area and inserts the mark by applying the XOR operation to the n-bits of the forensic mark bitstream and the key based pseudo random n-bits. Compared to the previous researches, the PSNR was 10dB higher, and the insertion speed increased by 70 times at 8K and 13 times at 4K. And robustness shows an average of 84.37% in 8K video.
